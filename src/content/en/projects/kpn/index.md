In KPN project I've played key role in creating POCs for open source test automation frameworks to enable DevOps practices and also implemented automated tests in CI/CD process in Java ecosystem. It was a big learning opportunity for me and helped me to grow in more intricate parts of framework and CI/CD process setup.
