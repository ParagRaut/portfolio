## I ♥️ Odido

I've been working for Odido NL B.V. (formerly T-Mobile NL B.V.) since June 2016. 
Development efforts mainly focuses on all the telecom domain related applications including customer facing applications such as self service portal & web apis for apps, internal facing applications for business and customer care executives.

Work also includes owning few responsibilities such as SAST tooling administration and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.

Also as side-projects created some manual time/effort saving applications thanks to the acquired functional/domain knowledge and experience.
In this project I became much more familiar with DevOps and agile (SAFe) working methodology. 

Most notable project that I've done within Odido are:
 - 1 Identity (IAM) project was geared towards aggregating all subscriptions owned by a customer under single account.
 - Brand revamp Odido which combined both T-Mobile and Tele2 brands to single brand.

This is my current project and I'm still learning new things everyday.
